# Code of Conduct

- Try your best to be respectful and composed. Be constructive with your criticisms. When providing negative feedback, attack concepts rather than people. Detailed opinions and reasoning is good, "[project] bad/cursed" is not.

- Don't be afraid to help out if you see someone in need of support. We were all beginners at some point, and everyone benefits from working together on problems.

- Don't ask to ask, just ask! Instead of asking for someone to help, state your problem directly. This makes it more likely for people to engage in conversation and try to help you. See: https://dontasktoask.com/
